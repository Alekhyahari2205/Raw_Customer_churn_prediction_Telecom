# Raw_Customer_churn_prediction_Telecom

Customer churn prediction aims to assess the reasons behind customers discontinuing their engagement with a business. In this project, we will focus on customer churn within the telecommunications industry. We will construct a deep learning model - Artificial Neural Network with 100 epochs to anticipate customer churn and employ precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate the efficacy of our model.
