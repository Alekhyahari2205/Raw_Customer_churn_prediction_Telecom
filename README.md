# Raw_Customer_churn_prediction_Telecom

Customer churn prediction aims to assess the reasons behind customers discontinuing their engagement with a business. In this project, we will focus on customer churn within the telecommunications industry. We will construct a deep learning model - Artificial Neural Network with 100 epochs to anticipate customer churn and employ precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate the efficacy of our model.

**Data Preprocessing and Insightful Visualization:**
- Thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, addressing missing values and ensuring data integrity.
- Utilized pandas for data manipulation and transformation, including the conversion of categorical features into numeric representations.
- Applied advanced data visualization techniques using matplotlib, allowing for the identification of key churn-related patterns.
- Focused on essential factors such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges, revealing actionable insights into customer behavior.

**Cutting-Edge Artificial Neural Network (ANN):**
- Implemented a high-performance Artificial Neural Network model using TensorFlow and Keras, featuring 100 training epochs.
- Optimized the model architecture with multiple hidden layers, employing the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function to enhance training efficiency.
- Employed the binary cross-entropy loss function for optimal convergence, along with the Adam optimizer to fine-tune model parameters.
- Trained the ANN on the preprocessed data, achieving an impressive 76% accuracy, while closely monitoring the training process.

**Discerning Churn Prediction Excellence:**
- Evaluated model performance with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, showcasing the ability to anticipate customer churn with a robust 56% F1-score.
- Emphasized the model's remarkable capability in non-churn prediction, achieving an outstanding 84% F1-score, thereby demonstrating its potential to identify and retain loyal customers.
- Visualized the confusion matrix with a heatmap to provide a clear representation of model predictions and actual outcomes.
- Successfully delivered a powerful customer churn prediction solution using cutting-edge deep learning techniques and rigorous data analysis.
